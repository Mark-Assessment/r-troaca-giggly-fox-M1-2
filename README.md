### **Color Scheme:**

When deciding the color scheme I wanted a dark and gritty main body with accents of orange representing the colour of the fox and white font text for a good contrast. The color palette was created using [https://coolors.co/]

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

### **Header Element**
The header element sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up and down the website. Originally I had designed the page with a "return to top" link at the bottom of the page. The navbar contains the following features:
#### *Title:*

![Page title](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/title.jpg?raw=true)
* The title represents the name of the club as well as giving an indication to what the logo is.
* Serves as a navigation link to the home page as well.

#### *Logo:*
The logo was created using an AI tool from [https://canva.com]

#### *Navigation Bar:*

* The navigation bar appears on all pages (including the form feedback page).
* Contains links to the Home, Shows, Comedians, and Contact page for quick navigation around the website. 
* The navbar also has a hover effect, which highlights the link that the cursor is hovering on top of.
* On mobile the navbar transforms into a togglable hamburger button.
