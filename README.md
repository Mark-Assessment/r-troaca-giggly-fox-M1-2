### **Color Scheme:**

When deciding the color scheme I wanted a dark and gritty main body with accents of orange representing the colour of the fox and white font text for a good contrast. The color palette was created using [https://coolors.co/]
![Color Palette](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/colorpalette.jpg?raw=true)

I also created this color contrast grid using [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%231A1E21%2C%0D%0A%23212529%2C%0D%0A%23343439%2C%0D%0A%23FFFFFF%2C%0D%0A%23ff5500%0D%0A%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp), to check the contrast scored and ensure the text remains visible across the entire website and that the site is accessible to everyone.

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

### **Header Element**
The header element sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up and down the website. Originally I had designed the page with a "return to top" link at the bottom of the page. The navbar contains the following features:
#### *Title:*

![Page title](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/title.jpg?raw=true)
* The title represents the name of the club as well as giving an indication to what the logo is.
* Serves as a navigation link to the home page as well.

#### *Logo:*
The logo was created using an AI tool from [https://canva.com]

![Logo](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/gigglyfoxlogo.webp?raw=true)

#### *Navigation Bar:*

* The navigation bar appears on all pages (including the form feedback page).
* Contains links to the Home, Shows, Comedians, and Contact page for quick navigation around the website. 
* The navbar also has a hover effect, which highlights the link that the cursor is hovering on top of.
* On mobile the navbar transforms into a togglable hamburger button.

![404 Erorr page message](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/404page.jpg?raw=true)

## **Future-Enhancements**
* Provided I would have had sufficient time, I would have added a few extra features to enhance the website's functionality. One of these would be a dedicated page to each comedian, allowing the comedian to share their latest videos and which shows are they doing down the road.
* I would also like to add a search bar at the top of the website, so the user can find specific information that they are looking for. These enhancements would make the website more user-friendly and accesible.

***

## **Testing Phase**

### **Testing During Development**
During the development process, I have been constantly testing the website in the following ways:

1. Manually testing each element of the page for responsiveness and accesibility via a live server opened using CodeAnywhere.

2. Published the page via GitHub pages and shared with friends and family to receive feedback.

3. Made use of Developer Tools from different Internet browsers, to continuously identify and troubleshoot any problems I encountered.
   
#### **Manual Testing**
* While testing the website, I have used 4 different browsers to make sure that it is cross-compatible. The desktop browsers I have used for the tesing were:

  - Firefox
  - Google Chrome
  - Microsoft Edge
  - DuckDuckGo
 
* I have also asked other people to test the website, using their personal iPhones and Macbooks using Safari, since I don't have access to these devices. To which they reported that they have not encountered any bugs.

#### **User Story Testing**
During my manual testing, I have tested every user story, to ensure that the needs of the users are met.

* As a user I want to see the subject matter of the page.
  - Issue: the About Us section didn't stand out, as to allow the user to notice it straight away.
  - Cause: the background of the About Us section was slightly darker than the body background.
  - Resolution: I added a 4px solid orange border, which captures the attention of the user and they can see the subject of the website in an instant.

* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate the page to find what I require in a quickly manner.
  - Issue: the user had to scroll for a long time up and down to find which section they were interested in.
  - Cause: the navbar was not fixed and there was no back to top button either.
  - Resolution: I added a back to top button to all 4 main pages, and I made the navbar fixed as well, so that the user can easily navigate the website.

* As a user I want to find the dates and times of show that I am interested in, without too much trouble.
  - Issue: the user could not find quickly all the times of the shows, from the landing page.
  - Cause: there was a list of shows on the Home page, but no button to take you to the Shows page instantly, without having to scroll all the way up to the top.
  - Resolution: I added a "View all shows" button that redirects the user straight to the Shows page.

* As a user I want to be able to find what comedians are performing at this venue.
  - Issue: the user could not find quickly all the comedians performing at the comedy club, from the Home page.
  - Cause: there was a section of Comedians on the landing page, but there wasn't any button to take you to the Comedians page instantly, without having to scroll all the way up to the top.
  - Resolution: I added a "View all comedians" button that takes the user instantly to the Comedians page.
  
* As a user I want to be able to contact the club easily.
   - Issue: the user could not contact the venue easily, without having to call the club.
   - Cause: there was an email address provided, but no contact form to make it easier for the user to contact The Giggly Fox.
   - Resolution: I added a contact form where the user can input their first and last name, email address, phone number and a text area where they can send all their questions and feedback to the club.

#### **Functionality testing**
* All the links, buttons and forms work as expected, with no errors.
  
#### **Bugs and fixes**
While manually testing I have encountered a couple of bugs:

* One of the first bugs that I have encountered was that I had a bit of overflow on the landing page, and the hero image and footer would not reach all the way to the right margin. To fix it, I added in style.css a min-height of 100% and a min-width of 100% plus a overflow-x: hidden;.

![Overflow bug](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/overflow.jpg?raw=true)

* Another bug I have encountered was that the "View all upcoming shows" and "View all comedians" buttons had a blue font after they were clicked. To fix this I had to change the button to a div that had a class of a button with a local link to the Shows page and Comedians page.

![Blue font button bug](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/buttonalwaysblue.png?raw=true)

* Other bugs that I have identified were:
  - Removing any unused CSS code.
  - Removing stray tags.
  - Ensuring proper spacing between elements inside the form.
  - Adding description meta tags to all pages for better search engine optimization and user understanding.

### **Testing After Development**
#### **Validators**

#### ***HTML*** - https://validator.w3.org/nu/

* All pages return no error.

#### ***CSS*** - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

* All pages tested, no issues found.
![CSS validator badge](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss)

#### **Lighthouse Scores**
- All lighthouse tests have been made while in incognito mode to avoid any browser extensions interference. 
- I have asked several people to run lighthouse tests from their own devices as well, and they were getting similar scores.

* Index.html

![Index.html lighthouse score](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/indexhtml.png?raw=true)

* Shows.html

![Shows.html lighthouse score](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/showshtml.png?raw=true)

* Comedians.html

![Comedians.html lighthouse score](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/comedianshtml.png?raw=true)

* Contact.html

![Contact.html lighthouse score](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/contacthtml.png?raw=true)

- All pages have performance scores slightly under optimum because of the following reasons:
   * Render blocking resources such as Javascript CDNs, but since I haven't learned Javascript yet I cannot insert inline Javascript.
   * Size of the image, but I have reduced the file-size as much as possible to keep the quality of the images and I have changed the file type to modern image file types such as "webp".

![Lighthouse performance issues](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/performance.jpg?raw=true)
